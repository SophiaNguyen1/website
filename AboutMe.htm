<p>Hello! My name is Sophia Nguyen. I graduated from William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute. I was in the MaCS program - a program for enriched math, science, and computer science - and this portfolio was a project from my ICS4U0 course! I love coding and I am able to program in Turing and Java. I got to where I am by working hard, always trying my best, taking chances, and staying positive.</p>
<p>Some things I enjoy include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Coding</li>
<li>Drawing and painting</li>
<li>Making digital designs</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Skills</h3>
<p>I am responsible, organized, hard-working, creative, and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>I love computer science, science, math, art, and English.</p> 
<h3>My Personality</h3>
<p>My personality type is INFJ. My personality type has a strong humanitarian outlook. I like doing things and getting closure as well as dreaming. I am both a visionary but I am practical as well. I am outgoing and sociable with others but I am sometimes reserved and like to have time for myself. I am empathetic and understanding. I am good with languages and am a good communicator. I am able to easily understand theories and apply them to situations. </p> 
<p>I am good at caring for other people, creative work, and intellectual work. Computer Science and Software Engineering is a perfect career choice for my personality type!</p>
<p>My learning style is that I learn better when I am interested in a topic and think that it could be beneficial to people. I like when I can make connections with what I'm learning and can improve my understanding of the topic. I am a visual learner. I study well both independently and with a group of people.</p>
<p>My communication skills are improved when I am passionate about what I’m talking about and I have time to think about what I want to say. I am a thoughtful and caring communicator. I prefer to plan things out instead of acting spontaneously. I am both sensing and intuitive because I can think logically but I can also feel what is right or wrong. </p>
<h3>My Goals</h3>
<p>My ultimate goal in life is to have a job that I love doing and to be happy. As for my education goals, my dream is to attend the University of Waterloo for their Computer Science or Software Engineering program. I hope to learn as much as I can, and use software to improve healthcare for everyone around the world.</p>
